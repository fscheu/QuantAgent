# Trading System Requirements

## Functional Requirements for Phase 1 MVP

### Overview

Transform QuantAgent from a demo analysis tool into an **automated paper trading system** that:
- Analyzes OHLC data automatically
- Executes trades in simulated environment
- Validates strategy through backtesting
- Tracks portfolio and performance metrics

**Focus**: Paper trading + backtesting validation (no real broker integration yet)

---

## New MVP Additions: Configuration, Provenance, Replay & Environments

The following additions strengthen reproducibility, auditability, and experimental agility while keeping scope focused.

### A. Preset Profiles for Portfolio & Risk (Configurable & Persisted)
Goal: Be able to pre‑set and persist different profiles (e.g., moderate by sector, aggressive by asset) and reuse them across backtests/paper trading.

Requirements:
- Persist named configurations for PortfolioManager and RiskManager (JSON profiles).
- Allow hierarchical overrides (default → sector → symbol), resolved into a final runtime config snapshot.
- Load a profile by name for any run; snapshot the resolved config into the run for reproducibility.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ Can create, list, and load portfolio/risk profiles by name.
- ✅ Backtest/paper run stores an immutable copy of the resolved profile (config snapshot).
- ✅ Switching profiles changes sizing/limits without code changes.

### B. Analysis Provenance Linked to Orders
Goal: Full traceability of “what analysis triggered an order” and “which analyses occurred during the order’s lifetime”.

Requirements:
- For each order, store the triggering analysis/signal reference.
- For each analysis/signal, allow linking to an associated order when applicable (before/during/after).

Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ Given an order, can retrieve the triggering analysis and the list of related analyses during its lifetime.
- ✅ Given an analysis, can find the order(s) it affected.

### C. Checkpoint Integration for Analyses (or Fallback Snapshot)
Goal: Every analysis record should point to its LangGraph checkpoint to enable full replay; if the checkpointer is unavailable, store a minimal state snapshot.

Requirements:
- Store `thread_id` and `checkpoint_id` alongside each analysis.
- If checkpointing library/DB is not available, store a compact `state_snapshot` (JSON) sufficient for replaying core results.
- Attach references to large artifacts (charts/images) by path/id (avoid large blobs in DB where possible).

Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ Can resume/replay an analysis from checkpoint when available.
- ✅ If checkpoint is not available, can reconstruct core analysis from `state_snapshot`.
- ✅ Charts are retrievable via their stored references.

### D. Backtest Setup Recording and Replayable Execution
Goal: A backtest records the full setup (profile snapshots, model settings, time ranges, assets) and generates a stable set of analyses that can be replayed with different Portfolio/Risk profiles without re‑calling LLMs.

Requirements:
- Persist a backtest “run” with parameters and config snapshot.
- Persist the generated analyses for that run with their model metadata.
- Provide a “replay execution” mode that consumes the same analyses but uses a different Portfolio/Risk profile to evaluate P&L/metrics without re‑generating analyses.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ Two executions over the same analysis set but different profiles yield two distinct P&L/metrics sets.
- ✅ Replay avoids making new LLM calls (uses stored analyses/checkpoints).

### E. Model Variants per (Symbol, Date, Timeframe)
Goal: Run multiple analysis variants for the exact same candle across different model providers/names/params, and later combine with various portfolio/risk profiles.

Requirements:
- Tag each analysis with `model_provider`, `model_name`, `temperature` and agent/graph version fields.
- Allow multiple analyses to exist for the same (symbol, timeframe, timestamp) differentiated by model metadata.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ Can query and compare analyses across model variants for identical candles.
- ✅ Backtest/execution can select a specific model variant set.

### F. Environment Separation (Backtest, Paper, Prod)
Goal: Keep experimental/backtest data clearly separated from production‑oriented records.

Requirements:
- Tag operational records (signals/analyses, orders, trades, positions) with an `environment` value: `backtest`, `paper`, or `prod`.
- All queries and dashboards can filter by environment.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ Backtest data does not pollute paper/prod dashboards.
- ✅ Paper and prod executions remain cleanly separable for reporting/audit.

## Core Requirements by Tier

### 🔴 TIER 1: CRITICAL

Requirements without which the system cannot function as a trading system.

#### 1.1 Portfolio Management & Position Tracking
**What**: Track current positions (qty, entry price, current price, P&L)

**Scope**:
- Store position state (in-memory during MVP)
- Calculate unrealized P&L real-time
- Track capital allocation
- Calculate portfolio value
- **Important**: Only updates state AFTER validated execution (no pre-trade validation)

**MVP Deliverable**:
```python
class PortfolioManager:
    positions: Dict[symbol] → {qty, avg_cost, current_price, pnl}
    cash: float

    def execute_trade(order: Order) → Trade:
        # ONLY updates positions/cash (validation happens in RiskManager)

    def get_total_value() → float
    def get_unrealized_pnl() → float
    def get_daily_pnl() → float
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Positions accurate vs. trades executed
- ✅ P&L calculations 100% correct
- ✅ Portfolio value = cash + position values
- ✅ No pre-trade validation (that's RiskManager's job)

---

#### 1.1b Position Sizer (NEW)
**What**: Calculate order size based on capital, confidence, and risk rules

**Scope**:
- Base position sizing: 5% of portfolio per trade
- Confidence-adjusted sizing: Low confidence = smaller position, High confidence = full size
- Volatility-aware sizing (future enhancement, not MVP)

**MVP Deliverable**:
```python
class PositionSizer:
    def calculate_size(symbol, signal_confidence, current_price, portfolio_value) → float:
        # Returns qty to buy/sell
        # Base: 5% of portfolio
        # Adjusted by confidence (0-1)
        # Examples:
        #   50% confidence → 2.5% position size
        #   100% confidence → 5% position size
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Sizes calculated correctly per confidence
- ✅ Never exceeds 10% portfolio limit
- ✅ Works for both BUY and SELL

---

#### 1.2 Risk Management System (RMS)
**What**: Validate trades BEFORE execution (gates the OrderManager)

**Pre-Trade Checks** (happens BEFORE broker execution):
- Sufficient capital available for trade value
- Position size within limits (max 10% of portfolio per trade)
- Daily loss limit not exceeded (max 5% per day)
- Circuit breaker not triggered
- No existing incompatible positions (for SHORT signals, e.g.)

**Architecture**:
- RiskManager.validate_trade() called by OrderManager BEFORE PaperBroker.place_order()
- If validation fails, order is REJECTED and never reaches broker
- No validation in PortfolioManager (that's post-execution only)

**MVP Deliverable**:
```python
class RiskManager:
    def validate_trade(symbol, qty, price) → (bool, reason):
        # Called BEFORE execution
        # Returns (is_valid, rejection_reason)
        # Checks all 5 pre-trade conditions above

    def get_daily_pnl() → float:
        # For circuit breaker check

    def on_trade_executed(trade: Trade) → None:
        # Post-trade: Update daily P&L tracking
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ No trades executed that violate risk rules
- ✅ Trades rejected at validate_trade(), never reach broker
- ✅ All rejections logged with reason
- ✅ Circuit breaker stops all trading if limit hit

---

#### 1.3 Order Manager (Orchestrator - NEW)
**What**: Orchestrates the complete order execution flow

**Responsibilities**:
1. Call PositionSizer to calculate order size
2. Call RiskManager to validate trade BEFORE execution
3. Create Order object
4. Call PaperBroker to execute (only if validated)
5. Call PortfolioManager to update positions
6. Log trade to database

**Execution Flow**:
```
Analysis (Decision + Confidence)
    ↓
OrderManager.execute_decision()
    ├─ PositionSizer.calculate_size() → qty
    ├─ RiskManager.validate_trade(symbol, qty, price) → (valid, reason)
    │   ├─ If False: REJECT (return None)
    │   └─ If True: continue
    ├─ PaperBroker.place_order(Order) → filled_order
    ├─ PortfolioManager.execute_trade(filled_order) → Trade
    ├─ RiskManager.on_trade_executed(trade) → update daily P&L
    └─ Database.add(trade)
```

**MVP Deliverable**:
```python
class OrderManager:
    def __init__(self, position_sizer, risk_manager, broker, portfolio, db):
        self.position_sizer = position_sizer
        self.risk_manager = risk_manager
        self.broker = broker
        self.portfolio = portfolio
        self.db = db

    def execute_decision(
        symbol: str,
        decision: str,        # "LONG" | "SHORT" | "HOLD"
        confidence: float,    # 0-1
        current_price: float
    ) → Optional[Order]:
        # Returns filled Order if executed, None if rejected
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Correct execution order (size → validate → execute → update → log)
- ✅ Trades rejected at validation stage (never reach broker if invalid)
- ✅ Successful trades update portfolio immediately
- ✅ All operations logged to database

---

#### 1.3b Paper Broker & Order Execution
**What**: Execute buy/sell orders in simulated environment (AFTER validation)

**Scope**:
- Place MARKET orders only (MVP)
- Simulate realistic fills (2% slippage)
- Track order status (PENDING → FILLED)
- Return fill price and quantity
- **Note**: Only receives validated orders from OrderManager

**MVP Deliverable**:
```python
class PaperBroker:
    def place_order(Order) → filled_Order:
        # Order already validated by RiskManager
        # Just execute with slippage simulation

    def get_positions() → Dict
    def get_balance() → float
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 100% order execution rate (all received orders are valid)
- ✅ Fills within simulated slippage (±2%)
- ✅ Returns filled order with actual fill price/qty

---

#### 1.4 Database Persistence
**What**: Store all trades, orders, signals, analysis results

**Schema**:
- `orders` - Order details (symbol, side, qty, price, status)
- `fills` - Fill details (order_id, fill_price, fill_qty, timestamp)
- `positions` - Current positions (symbol, qty, avg_cost)
- `signals` - Analysis signals (symbol, timeframe, decision, reason, timestamp)
- `trades` - Closed trades (symbol, entry_price, exit_price, pnl)

**MVP Deliverable**:
- SQLite database with above schema
- Insert trades on execution
- Query trades/signals for backtesting

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All trades persisted to database
- ✅ Queries work correctly
- ✅ No data loss on restart

---

### 🟠 TIER 2: ESSENTIAL

Requirements needed for MVP to be useful.

#### 2.1 Backtesting Framework
**What**: Run analysis on historical data and measure performance

**Scope**:
- Loop through historical dates
- Execute analysis on each date (like live)
- Compare decision vs actual price 4h later
- Calculate metrics: win rate, profit factor, Sharpe ratio

**MVP Deliverable**:
```python
class Backtest:
    run(start_date, end_date, assets) → results
    results = {
        "total_trades": int,
        "win_rate": float,
        "profit_factor": float,
        "total_pnl": float,
        "max_drawdown": float
    }
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Backtest completes without errors
- ✅ Metrics calculated correctly
- ✅ Win rate ≥ 40% (viability threshold)
- ✅ Backtest run stores full setup (config snapshot, model settings, assets, date range)
- ✅ Replay execution can reuse stored analyses with different portfolio/risk profiles

---

#### 2.2 Paper Trading Scheduler
**What**: Run analysis and execute trades automatically at intervals

**Scope**:
- Trigger analysis every N hours (default: 1 hour)
- Execute decision if signal present
- Log all activities

**MVP Deliverable**:
```python
class TradingScheduler:
    start() → runs analysis hourly
    stop() → stops scheduler
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Analysis runs at scheduled times
- ✅ Trades execute automatically
- ✅ System stable for 24h+ of testing
- ✅ Environment tagging is applied as `paper` for all generated records

---

#### 2.3 Data Caching Layer
**What**: Cache market data locally to speed up backtesting and reduce API calls

**Scope**:
- Store OHLC data in database by symbol/timeframe
- Check DB first before API call
- Fallback to yfinance if data missing
- Store fetched data for future use

**MVP Deliverable**:
```python
class DataProvider:
    get_ohlc(symbol, timeframe, start_date, end_date) → DataFrame
    # Returns cached if available, fetches + caches if not
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Backtesting 10x faster (local DB queries)
- ✅ API calls reduced significantly
- ✅ Reproducible results (same data every run)
- ✅ Backtests reference a data source/hash for reproducibility

---

#### 2.4 Logging & Monitoring
**What**: Record all system events with sufficient detail for debugging

**Scope**:
- Log every decision (why made)
- Log every order (placed, filled, rejected)
- Log every error with stacktrace
- Searchable by time, symbol, event type

**MVP Deliverable**:
- Structured logging to files
- Rotation daily
- JSON format for parseability

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Can find "all BTC trades on 2024-11-25"
- ✅ Can find "all risk rejections"
- ✅ Can replay any day's activity
- ✅ Given an order id, can retrieve triggering analysis and related analyses (provenance)
- ✅ Given a run id, can retrieve the config snapshot used

---

### 🟡 TIER 3: IMPORTANT (Phase 1 or Phase 2)

**What**: Externalize settings without code changes

**Config Options**:
- Assets to analyze (["BTC", "SPX", "CL"])
- Analysis frequency (hours between runs)
- Risk limits (max loss, position size)
- LLM provider selection

**MVP Deliverable**:
- YAML config file
- Environment variables for secrets
- Validation at startup
- Profiles persisted (Portfolio/Risk) and selectable by name

---

#### 3.2 Dashboard Monitoring
**What**: Web interface to see system status

**Pages**:
