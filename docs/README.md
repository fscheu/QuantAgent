- **[trading_system_requirements.md](01_requirements/trading_system_requirements.md)**
  - What we're building (detailed specs)
  - Acceptance criteria for each feature
  - API contracts and data models
  - Success criteria for MVP

### 02_planning/
**Purpose**: Roadmaps, timelines, and task management

- **[phase1_roadmap.md](02_planning/phase1_roadmap.md)**
  - Timeline: Week 1-10
  - Week-by-week tasks
  - Key decisions made
  - Go/no-go criteria

  - Future features (real broker, FastAPI+Angular, macro agents)
  - Timeline: Weeks 11-20+
  - Advanced features
  - Expected improvements

### 03_design/
**Purpose**: Technical architecture and implementation decisions

- **[docker_deployment.md](03_design/docker_deployment.md)**
  - Lightweight Docker setup (PostgreSQL in container)
  - Development workflow
  - Production deployment approach
  - Troubleshooting

- **[data_caching_architecture.md](03_design/data_caching_architecture.md)**
  - How we cache market data locally
  - Database schema for OHLC data
  - Implementation details
  - Performance characteristics

- **[MIGRATIONS.md](03_design/MIGRATIONS.md)**

  - Model definitions and relationships

### 04_decisions/
**Purpose**: Architecture decision records

- **[ui_framework_decision.md](04_decisions/ui_framework_decision.md)**
  - Why Streamlit for MVP
  - Why FastAPI+Angular for Phase 2
  - Hybrid migration strategy
  - Code examples

Note on UI: Current UI in this repo is Flask (`apps/flask/web_interface.py`). Streamlit dashboard is proposed for MVP and is marked as Planned in the UI document.

Language: Documentation is bilingual (English/Spanish). Dev tools and workflow guides are in Spanish; most architecture and planning docs are in English.

## 🎯 Key Decisions Summary

### 5 Major Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Data Caching** | Local DB cache | Backtesting 10x faster |
| **MVP Scope** | Paper trading + Backtesting | Validate before execution |
| **Future Agents** | Macro agents in Phase 2 | Don't overcomplicate MVP |
| **Docker** | Lightweight setup | Portability + corporate friendly |
| **UI Framework** | Streamlit → FastAPI+Angular | Fast MVP, professional Phase 2 |
